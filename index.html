			<h3>Who Has Influenced You The Most?</h3>
			
			<p>No one really. I just do my own thing. </p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>What Has Been Your Best Moment This Year (So Far)?</h3>
			
			<p>I got engaged to my life-long best friend and love of my life over the summer.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>What Would You Like To Change About Yourself?</h3>
			
			<p>Ideally, I’d like to lose weight, but I’m not very motivated to do so. My fiancee says she likes me the way I am so I guess I won't be doing anything about it.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>What Motivates You To Get Up Every Morning?</h3>
			
			<p>I get to see my cat, who I love very much, and then I get to leave and see my friends or my fiancee.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>If You Could Do Anything For The Rest Of Your Life, What Would That Be?</h3>
			
			<p>I would like to draw or spend time with the family I’m going to have. My fiancee and I are going to have at least one kid. If we have a daughter we’re going to name her Evelyn.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>If You Could Live Anywhere In The World For A Year, Where Would It Be?</h3>
			
			<p>Vancouver. It’s about as far away from here as I could get without leaving Canada.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>What Would You Like To Eat For Your Last Meal?</h3>
			
			<p>Sit me in an all-you-can-eat buffet and then my “last meal” would be endless.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>Would You Rather Be Bald Or Covered From Head To Toe In Hair?</h3>
			
			<p>Bald. It would be nice never having to shave again. Just give me a wig and I’m good.</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>What aspects of graphic design to you gravitate towards?</h3>
			
			<p>I like both digital and physical media. I dropped 2k on a laptop/tablet just for artistic purposes</p>
		</section>

				<section class="toggle">
			<h3>Why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
			
			<p>It’s the only career choice that highschool made me somewhat passionate about. I was in the Yearbook class at Notre Dame grades 10-12 and it was the only class I ever got an average of 100 in.</p>
